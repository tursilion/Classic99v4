From Matt - check this decrement:
[2:15 PM] dnotq: The counters don't consider the 0-count as it's own state.  It was very interesting that I literally took the AY up-counters, changed them to count down (changed ++ to -), and changed the reset when count >= period condition to load-period when count = 0, and they just worked.
[2:16 PM] dnotq: It took me a while to realize this, since when you mentioned 0-count is maximum period, that threw me for a bit.
[2:17 PM] tursilion: yeah, I said that. But I think the SN was the first and everyone else cloned them ;)
[2:17 PM] dnotq: But the "compare-to-0 and load" is done during the period of the count.  Easier to show than to explain in English.
[2:18 PM] dnotq: It was just neat to see the same mechanism work in both directions.  Everyone else is loading the count - 1 and crap like that into their counters, or making special cases for the 0 count, etc.
[2:19 PM] tursilion: huh, weird. I don't understand your "during the period of the count" bit, as you implied ;)
[2:21 PM] dnotq: It means that the reset-and-count happens in the same time period as a single count.  So when you hit zero, the period is loaded, then decremented immediately.  So the counter being "zero" is never try for a full count period.
[2:21 PM] dnotq: This is what allows a count of 1 to actually cut the frequency in half.
[2:22 PM] dnotq: If zero was true for a full count cycle, a count of one would be: 1, 0 (toggle), 1, 0 (toggle).  And that is actually a divide by 2.
[2:26 PM] dnotq: It is done in the real IC via the asynchronous nature of the transistors, and the way any signal transition can be a clock, set, or reset signal.  But I reproduced the functionality in synchronous HDL and the counters just work as they should.  No special tests, edge cases, loading or comparing period-1, etc.
[2:27 PM] tursilion: ah, I see. That makes sense :) I should check if Classic99 does that right

// Real TI testing on wait states:
// I got times of 6.96, 7.36 and 9.36 us of active time on the sound chip WE pin. 
// Semi-random, though 7.36 was notably less common. Need to check the waveforms but
// that'll largely correspond to the hold time from the sound chip plus the multiplexer.
// That does mean the hold time in cycles might not be fixed? A cycle is 0.3uS, so that's
// 20.88 cycles, 22.08 cycles, and 28.08 cycles. I'm using a fixed 28 cycles in TIEMUL.H,
// so that matches earlier observations, except I didn't notice how much it varied.

// Testing on a real TI:
// The sound chip itself outputs an always positive sound wave peaking roughly at 2.8v.
// Output values are roughly 1v peak-to-peak (I measured 0 attenuation at roughly 720mV)
// However, it's hard to get good readings in the TI console due to lots of high frequency
// noise, which is also roughly 1v peak to peak and starts at around 1khz or 2khz
// The center point at output was closer to 1v, nevertheless, it's all positive.
// Two interesting points - rather than a center point, the maximum voltage appeared
// to be consistent, and the minimum voltage crept higher as attenuation increased.
// The other interesting point is that MESS seems to output all negative voltage,
// but in the end where in the range it lands doesn't matter so much (in fact my
// positive/negative swing probably doesn't even matter, but we can fix it).
// I measured these approximate values. They are less accurate as they get smaller
// because of the high noise (a sound chip out of circuit on an AVR or such
// would be a good experiment). But we can line them up with the approximate
// scale and see if it makes sense:
//
// From 0-15, I read (mV):
// 720, 600, 488, 407, 384, 328, 272, 232,
// 176, 160, 136, 120, 112, 104, 72, 0
//
// Again, measured by hand in a noisy system, so just use as very loose confirmation
// data, rather than anything exact.
//
// As a potential thought -- centering our output on zero instead of making it all positive
// means we play more nicely with the Windows system (ie: no click, no DC offset), and
// so it may be worth leaving it that way. It should still sound the same.
//

// Based on documentation on the SN76489 from SMSPOWER
// and datasheets for the SN79489/SN79486/SN79484,
// and recordings from an actual TI99 console (gasp!)
//
// Decay to zero is roughly 1% of maximum every 500uS
// My math suggests that the volume would thus decay by
// 0.01 every 1431.818 clocks (real clocks, not clock/16)
//
// The clock dividers in this file don't look correct according
// to the datasheets, but till I find more accurate details
// on the 9919 itself I'll leave them be. And they work.

// The 15 bit shift register is more or less simulated here -
// I need to do some measurements on the real TI and see if
// I can figure out from the doc what the real chip is doing --
// by using the user-controlled rate I can set the shift register
// to a desired speed and thus measure it.

// One interesting note from this... for getting "bass" from the
// periodic register, the periodic output is going to be
// ticking at (frequency count / 2) / 15 
// The tick count for tones is 111860.78125Hz (exactly on NTSC - are PAL consoles detuned?)
// The tick count for periodic noise if 15-bit is about 3728.6927
//
// It's a little harder to measure the white noise register, we'd have
// to work out where the tap points are by looking at the pattern.
//
// Note that technically, the datasheet says the chip needs 32 cycles to
// deal with the audio data, but we assume immediate. Also, note that
// the dB attenuation is +/- 1dB, but we assume perfect accuracy. In short,
// the chip is really pretty crummy, but we emulate a perfect one.
// Note anyway that 32 cycles at 3.58MHz is 8.9uS - just /slightly/
// slower than the fastest 9900 write cycle (MOVB Rn,*Rm = 26 cycles = 8.63uS)
// On the later chip that took a 500kHz clock (not used in the TI?)
// only 4 clocks were needed, so it was 8.0uS to respond.
// This means the normally used sound chip can potentially /just barely/
// be overrun by the CPU, but we should be fine with this emulation.
// (In truth, the time it takes to fetch the next instruction should make it
// impossible to overrun.)
//
// Futher note: the TI CPU is halted by the sound chip during the write,
// so not only is overrun impossible, but the system is halted for a significant
// time. This is now emulated on the CPU side.
//
// Another neat tidbit from RL -- don't track the fractional loss from
// the timing counters -- your ear can hear when they are added in, and
// you get periodic noise, depending on the frequency being played!
