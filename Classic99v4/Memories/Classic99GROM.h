// memory-mapped GROM memory emulation
// GROM is accessed via just a couple of access ports
// repeated in memory. Console GROM doesn't support the GROM banking concept.
// >9800 - read data        peripheral address 0
// >9802 - read address     peripheral address GROM_MODE_ADDRESS
// >9C00 - write data       peripheral address GROM_MODE_WRITE
// >9C02 - write address    peripheral address GROM_MODE_WRITE|GROM_MODE_ADDRESS
//
// GROMS have their own 13-bit internal address bus and only respond when they are
// being addressed, as determined by the top three addresses bits (which they
// apparently also remember, but are not part of the incremented register).
// In addition, real TI GROMs only contain 6k, though reside within an 8k
// window. The additional 2k, if accessed, tends to contain a bizarre OR-ing
// of bytes that implies the internal structure is a 2k ROM plus a 4k ROM,
// which certainly makes more sense than 6k. If the end of a GROM is read, the
// address counter wraps around but the match bits do not change, causing
// the memory to wrap around to the beginning of the current GROM.
// 
// Although each chip has its own address counter, they are all attached to
// the same bus, so there is technically only ONE address counter. Technically,
// multiple bases probably have multiple addresses, as does the pCode counter,
// but there seems no way in the TI system to access chips other than the currently
// addressed one, and changing the address updates all the prefetches, so there's
// no need to store per chip. 
// 
// TODO: bases need some thought, particularly getting console GROMs in all bases
//
// The console contains three GROMs:
// >0000 - boot and basic operating system
// >2000 - first part of TI BASIC
// >4000 - second part of TI BASIC
